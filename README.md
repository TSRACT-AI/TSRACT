# TSRACT: .NET Language Model LoRA Training & Inference Tool

TSRACT is an open-source tool that allows you to train language model LoRAs and run inference on a local GPU. It is designed to be run and accessed locally on a single machine. You can deploy this to cloud GPU services such as RunPod and access it remotely.

## Features:
- Train 4-bit LoRA on LLaMA-based models
- Queue multiple LoRA trainings back-to-back
- Utilizes the Huggingface Datasets, Hub, PEFT, and Transformers libraries
- Weights & Biases integration
- Token probability analysis tool

## üöÄ Getting Started

### On Windows
TSRACT Windows compatibility is shaky at this time. Still sorting out CUDA/bitsandbytes-related issues.

### On Runpod
1. Start a new pod using the `RunPod Pytorch 2.0.1` template, be sure to include 40-50GB of storage and open ports `8888,5000`. `8888` will be for the JupyterLab console and `5000` will be for TSRACT.
2. `apt-get update && apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-7.0` to install the .NET 7 SDK.
3. If you will be training LoRAs, you must do `pip install wandb && wandb login` and enter your API key, if you are only running inference you can skip this step.
4. `git clone https://github.com/TSRACT-AI/TSRACT.git && cd TSRACT`
5. You should pre-download models as the auto-downloader does not currently report progress to the TSRACT UI. Working on it! You can run `python download-base-model.py` to download `openlm-research/open_llama_7b` to get started.
6. `chmod +x ./start-linux-baremetal.sh`
7. `./start-linux-baremetal.sh` will install the remaining Python dependencies and run TSRACT on port 5000.
8. From the RunPod Connect dialog, click the button to connect on port 5000.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes
- This is an early release version of TSRACT. Things are a bit messy and will be cleaned up before many new features are added.
- The near-term vision is to add peer-to-peer connectivity or a hub-and-spoke system to connect TSRACT nodes together. You will be able to queue up multiple LoRA training jobs and distribute them to other nodes.
- Although the user interface is presented in a web browser, this software is designed to be used by a single individual or run unattended while running a training queue. TSRACT will not be stable with multiple users connecting to the same instance.
- The default behavior is to listen on localhost only, since there is no authentication by default. On RunPod, the startup script passes the `--listen-all-bindings=true` command line argument to bypass the localhost restriction.
